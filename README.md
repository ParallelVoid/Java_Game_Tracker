# Game Cataloguing System
This application is for cataloguing one's collection of video games.

## Who will use it?
The primary targets are users who either collect video games or have a large backlog of games that they hope to play.

## Why is this project interesting to me:
- I have a large collection of games, and many of them remain unplayed/untested
- I have a similar application on my mobile phone that I would like to improve on the concept
    - I want to show the user how much of the game they actually played, which may encourage them to try more of their games and not just buy more without experiencing the games they already have
    - It would not have to rely on a database that may or may not be aware if a game you have exists
    - Incorporate ways to search for *unplayed*/*played*/*completed* games, with a percent value
    - Be able to view the games you own for each system/platform
